# SAE-dash
Arduino IDE compatible code to drive the dashboard on Wentworth Institute of Technology's SAE BAJA car

##Hardware Test
This sketch lights the LEDs up in order along the rows as a fun demo!

##Dash
This is the main code for actual dashboard ops

##Thermoconfig
This configures the IR Thermometer. It only needs to be run once, and it's already been run, so you shouldn't need to touch it.

##Thermotest
This is a very simple breadboard test sketch for the IR thermometer.
